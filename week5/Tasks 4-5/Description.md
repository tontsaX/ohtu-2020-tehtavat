Tasks 4-5 of part 5
These tasks were basically a one task combination. In the task the students were
provided with three calculator programs, which they were supposed to refactor some
of the parts in it. The idea was to learn how to use abstract classes and 
interface implementations in command style programming. The gui elements were
left untouched. In task 5 you were supposed to add an undo method to already
existing undo button.
